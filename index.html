                <p>If I have to describe myself in three adjectives, it will be: adventurous, curious and funny.</p>
                <p>I was born and raised in a small rural town 50 miles North from Sai Gon. I immigrated to the U.S in 2014 when I was 18. I entered college as an architecture undergrad, then "SNAP!!" I graduated with a degree in Microbiology.</p>
                <p>During the time in college, I was totally intrigued by literally everything. Particularly, community service, innovation and entreprenuership have been sticking with me for the longest, and they gradually became the foundation of my passion and life purposes. Shortly after graduation, I joined AmeriCorps-Public Allies, a progressive leadership program which I got to work with many different non-profits in central Phoenix, be apart of great projects and met so many wonderful souls.</p>
                <p>Due to my prior experience in data analysis when I worked in bacterial genetic laboraroty, my organization nominated me along with 12 others to work with Amazon Web Services in creating a software prototype that help the organization improve in streamlining infomation across 20 different agencies that are under their umbrella. This opportunity introduced me to technology and how it can be an integral part of solution to complex issue.</p>
                <p>That is the story of why I am taking coding bootcamp at University of Arizona. Until now, I'm still amazed at the milestone I'm taking, and I can't be more excited to learn more about this field in the next 5 months. It's going to be hard, but it's also going to be fun.</p>
